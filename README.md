# Probability & Statistical Data Analysis - Project 2

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify and analyze the key determinants of life expectancy using data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and supplementary economic data from the United Nations. By incorporating various health, economic, social, and immunization-related factors, we developed a predictive model to help countries understand and improve their life expectancy rates.

### Introduction or Background
The study explores the factors influencing life expectancy, focusing on often-overlooked variables such as immunization rates and the Human Development Index (HDI). By examining data from 2000 to 2015 across 193 countries, the study provides a comprehensive perspective on life expectancy determinants.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and includes various variables such as country, year, life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, GDP, and immunization rates. Detailed data descriptions and measurement levels are provided in the project report.

### Data Analysis
We conducted multiple statistical analyses, including hypothesis testing, correlation tests, multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and chi-square tests. The analyses helped us understand the relationships between life expectancy and various predictors such as GDP, adult mortality, BMI, and HIV/AIDS prevalence.

## Reflection
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the complex factors affecting life expectancy. Working with real-world data from WHO and the UN challenged me to think critically about the numerous variables that influence health outcomes. One of the most significant learnings was understanding the interplay between economic indicators and health metrics. For example, the relationship between GDP and life expectancy highlighted how economic stability can directly impact a population's health.

Furthermore, the project underscored the importance of immunization programs in enhancing life expectancy. Analyzing the data showed me how preventative health measures, often taken for granted in more developed countries, are crucial for improving life expectancy in lower-income regions.

On a technical level, I improved my skills in statistical analysis and data visualization, using tools like regression models and hypothesis testing to derive meaningful conclusions from complex datasets. This experience has not only deepened my understanding of statistical methods but also reinforced the importance of a holistic approach in public health research. The findings from this project have provided a solid foundation for future policy recommendations and have motivated me to continue exploring the field of data-driven health analytics.
