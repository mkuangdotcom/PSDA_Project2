# Probability & Statistical Data Analysis - Project 2

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify and analyze the key determinants of life expectancy using data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and supplementary economic data from the United Nations. By incorporating various health, economic, social, and immunization-related factors, we developed a predictive model to help countries understand and improve their life expectancy rates.

### Introduction or Background
The study explores the factors influencing life expectancy, focusing on often-overlooked variables such as immunization rates and the Human Development Index (HDI). By examining data from 2000 to 2015 across 193 countries, the study provides a comprehensive perspective on life expectancy determinants.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and includes various variables such as country, year, life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, GDP, and immunization rates. Detailed data descriptions and measurement levels are provided in the project report.

### Data Analysis
We conducted multiple statistical analyses, including hypothesis testing, correlation tests, multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and chi-square tests. The analyses helped us understand the relationships between life expectancy and various predictors such as GDP, adult mortality, BMI, and HIV/AIDS prevalence.

## Reflection
Through this project, we gained valuable insights into the complex factors affecting life expectancy. The integration of diverse variables, including economic and health indicators, highlighted the importance of a holistic approach in public health research. The findings underscore the significance of immunization and economic stability in enhancing life expectancy, providing a solid foundation for future policy recommendations.
